Description: Adjust installation paths in CMakeLists.txt
 Adjust the installation paths in CMakeLists.txt to match the
 paths used in Debian:
 - The udev-rules should be installed into /lib/udev/rules.d.
 - The locale file for German is installed into /usr/share/locale/de
   instead of /usr/share/locale/de_DE.
